# Digout

##Installation
In order to install and run you will have to perform the following tasks:

1) Copy this file to the root of the folder: https://www.dropbox.com/s/h1ltpk8r2fj48t5/Q4M?dl=0

**Note**
This is the IBM Mobile Quality Assurance framework. It is not included by default because the file size is too big to track.

2) CD to the root of the folder and run `carthage update --platform ios`

**Note** This will install the required dependencies for third party frameworks.
